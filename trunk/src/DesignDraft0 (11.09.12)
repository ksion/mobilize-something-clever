As a user, I want to :
	- RSVP for concerts
	- View upcoming concerts
	- learn more about AMP
		~ become a teacher artist
		~ sign my kid up for program
	

Potential Tabs for Entire Screen... (4 total)
- Home (for returning)
- Concerts & Events (has
						- Calendar/Schedule of Events
						- contains a click through for
							RSVP capability
					)
- ? (not sure what this tab should contain)
- More...(has 
			- Donate
			- Contact
			- Get Involved (has 
								- Become a Leader
								- Sign my Kids Up
							)
			- About Us (has
							- Mission Statement
							- Teacher Artist Bio
						)
		)
		
RSVP Form...
- should contain...
	Name: (First, Last)
	Phone: (Area Code, Number)
	Number of Guest: (potentially a spinner, and a label
							for available seats or max capacity)
	Email Address: (valid email address)
- probably email Dante or Aisha everytime the submit button is
pressed, then we could prevent the use of a database...just send
them as they come...
