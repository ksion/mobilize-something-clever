		<h1>ABOUT AMP</h1>
		<p>Founded in 2010, the Atlanta Music Project provides intense
		music education for underserved youth right in their neighborhood.
		Inspired by Venezuela’s El Sistema, our after-school, youth orchestra
		and choir programs take place 3-5 days a week for 2 hours each day.
		The Atlanta Music Project is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization.</p>
		</br>
		<p>AMP believes the pursuit of musical excellence leads to the
		development of confidence, creativity and ambition, thus sparking
		positive social change in the individuals and the communities we
		serve.</p>
		<h1>EL SISTEMA USA</h1>
		<p>In 2009, José Antonio Abreu, the founder of El Sistema, was awarded 
		the TED Prize. He was awarded $100,000 and one wish to change the world. 
		His wish was to “Create and document a special training program for 50 
		gifted young musicians passionate about their art and social justice and 
		dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States and the world.”</p>
