	<h1>ORCHESTRA TEACHER ARTIST</h1>
	<p>While trained at some of the world’s greatest music
	 schools, AMP Teaching Artists are more than just first-rate 
	 performers. The AMP Teaching Artists are musicians with social 
	 change in mind, with the desire to pass on their talent and 
	 art to the next generation and with the ability to play a 
	 role in youth and community development. Honing their craft by 
	 day and showcasing it in concerts by night, the AMP Teaching 
	 Artists spend their afternoons in some of Atlanta’s most 
	 disadvantaged communities teaching the young students of the 
	 Atlanta Music Project so they can in turn inspire social change 
	 in their communities through their own musical abilities and 
	 concerts. For more about AMP Teacher Artist click

					International Music Festivals and performed solo masterclasses for 
					famous cellists such as Norman Fisher, Evan Drachman, Stefan Kartman,
